Now, we are looking to create a POC component which will be using Google Maps API mapping. API key as follows: 'AIzaSyCJcQHAjA6-T_u8VrhAxxdeRZ-3c037qIU'.

Specifically:

- we are working on this flogect as mobile first approach.
- a map centered in the middle of Yorkshire and The Humber, UK
- place markers for each major city in Yorkshire and The Humber area. On users click an info window should open with basic information about each city.
- the boundaries of Yorkshire and The Humber should be highlighted with dashed line of navy blue colour for good visibitily. search online for geodata for this purpose. make it so that Yorkshire and The Humber boundaries are automatically fit in devices screen.
